# Ethernet-Chat
Ethernet Chat is a Python-based desktop application that enables direct messaging and file transfer between devices on the same local network using raw Ethernet frames. The project features a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter, allowing users to send text messages and files to specific MAC addresses or broadcast to all devices. Communication occurs at the data link layer, bypassing traditional network protocols, making it ideal for secure, low-level, or protocol-independent local communication and educational purposes.
